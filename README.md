## Q/A
- Why does Jail teleport me to nowhere?

**It's how SCPET does Seeding, unfortuantly I cannot fix this. If this happens, use freeze**

- Why are errors appearing in the console when running commands such as speed or nickname

**UnityObjects getting destroyed, this will be fixed in the near future**

- Why did Jail get disabled?

**Unreliablity with Map Generation, the command at its current stage is clunky and unreliable. I will push a release if the surface generation is fixed or we find a fix for it**
