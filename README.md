## Q/A
- Why does Jail teleport me to nowhere?

**It's how SCPET does Seeding, unfortuantly I cannot fix this. If this happens, use freeze**

- Why are errors appearing in the console when running commands such as speed or nickname

**UnityObjects getting destroyed, this will be fixed in the near future**
